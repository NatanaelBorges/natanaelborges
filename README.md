😲 Useless facts about me: You can usually find me tinkering with my homebrew setup or perfecting my BBQ technique. There's just something so satisfying about the process of creating something delicious from scratch. Plus, nothing beats the feeling of sharing a cold beer or a plate of perfectly smoked ribs with loved ones. For me, brewing and barbecuing are more than just hobbies - they're a way of life!

😂 Useful facts about me: I love to do in my free time: brewing beer and firing up the barbecue.
